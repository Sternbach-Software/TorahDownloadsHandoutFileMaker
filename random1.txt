Speech in yeshiva 5781:
Big ideas:
•	Pesach is so joyous because it is a yom tov celebrating that I get to do mitzvos and be a servant of Hashem
•
Pesach is a more special yom tov to me than any other yom tov, and I would like to share with you why that is.
Pesach is a more joyous yom tov for me than any other yom tov, and I would like to share that with you now: (answer:because it contains within it the Simcha or every other yom tov, because it is the yom tov celebrating my going out of my personal mitzrayim and being able to come and serve Hashem on all of the other yomim tovim, and along with them to be able to do all of the mitzvos, and that is the greatest Simcha there can be. (It is an infinite Simcha, because laden within it is the potential for every other mitzvah. – include that?)
•	Yeshiva is a mikva
<editor-fold>
   o	Like hillel (side detail – consider taking out)
      	Kal v’chomer going inside the walls purifies
</editor-fold>
•	Seeing the potential, like
   o	Rivka and the twins in the womb
   o	Hashem taking us out of Egypt (should probably start with this: it is really the theme of the whole speech, unless I should start with how I was not interested in yiddishkeit)
      	The yaaros devash shabos shuva drasha?
      	Pesukim in yechezkel
   o	Seeing the end is an olam-haba-dik-a outlook
•	Nezem zahav which was saved from the snout of a pig, a beautiful woman who (has a bad smell?)
   o	The ring has a bad smell until it is cleaned off, but it is ???? beautiful.
•	Yeshiva is a time to see that you are a golden ring, like the rosh yeshiva said regarding the yomim tovim, rosh Hashanah-Yom kippur: the high points/times of inspiration are times to see that you really do have a connection and desire for spiritual things.
   o	Shovavim is a time to connect with that
•	Being a ba’al teshuva is dirty and full of imperfections, but Hashem took us out of mitzrayim despite our imperfections, because he saw the potential in us.
   o	Hearing someone learn to play piano and make mistakes
   o	A child learning a language
•	It may come as a surprise to many of you, but when I first came to YGW in 7th grade, I had absolutely no interest in Yiddishkeit and I only wanted to hear things which could be proven with logic or science. If it wasn’t logical or it couldn’t be proven, I wasn’t interested in hearing it. I came in saying, “I am a straight-A student, and in math I’m two grades ahead; you won’t confuse me with any of your touchy-feely ideas – If you want to talk to me, I am only interested in hearing straight logic.”
   o	This was the challenge of  (it was not (they were sure there was a god or gods) – take this out, it is not true)???, and it has been a real challenge for me: to see beyond what is right in front of me and keep reminding myself that there really is a Hashem in this world. For some people, believing in Hashem came naturally to them. For me it wasn’t that way at all. (Rephrase)
      	When the same level of fluke happens over and over again, you start to get the pattern. (Rephrase)
   o	Talk how Rabbi Yosef Elephant is probably the single person most responsible for me being frum today, and he doesn’t even know I exist.
      	After I had exhausted all of my questions and logical conundrums about the existence of a God, slowly climbing the proverbial mountain of uncertainty, I finally arrived at the top. But as I stood in the serenity of understanding what could and could not be understood, I realized the decision I was faced with, and that it would go beyond anywhere I was able to go just using my ???: to believe that there is a God. Not to prove or convince or deduce by logical inference or scientifically verifiable truths , but to know that there is a God from the sole intuition of what I know to be true from the depths of my existence. It was the most intense and 50/50 decision of my entire life. As I stood in that place of clarity, I realized that to go any further would require being 100% honest and doing something which could not be backed by facts or arguments, and that the trajectory of the rest of my life could dramatically change depending on how I came out at the end of the decision. I honestly don’t remember how I made that decision. [pause to let the idea sink in].
      	As I was trying to think back to what ideas and events made the biggest impact on me in terms of making me feel more comfortable with the existence of a God, I was having a hard time remembering one or two events or ideas which really changed the status quo for me. I think that the process was so subtle, the product of a number of factors, and over an extended period of time, that there was no one moment or idea which really convinced me, until one day when someone mentioned the concept that there is a God in this world, I thought, “Yeah…[slight pause to reflect a minute hesitance] that makes sense to me. I can accept that.” … and paraxodically, tefillos being answered (Whoa, that worked), the  second one which stood out for me lack of randomness in my life and how many things have worked out in the end and how many things worked out well when they could have gone very wrong
•	Adding on to the last thing I spoke about, I could have explained away Rabbi Shwartz calling me as sheer luck, and along with that story, all of the other times in my life… (I had something happen which could be explained either way, but to look deeper and make an honest cheshbon hanefesh and realize that it felt right to say that Hashem was involved.)
•	Others may see us as having a bad smell/ coming off as course or rough around the edges, and we may see that in ourselves, but understand that we are coming from a place of dirty imperfection (rephrase), and who we are today is a ring of gold saved from the snout of a pig. We have grown before, and we will continue to grow. We request from other and from ourselves that we see past the current appearance and see “what will be in the end”.
   o	We are a nation because Hashem was able to look past the here-and-now and have mercy on us for who we will be.
   o	Kicking a very serious video game addiction
•	I had a very interesting experience a few weeks ago when I spent some time looking back at the poetry I was writing when I was in 6th and 7th grade. I have been writing poetry for 9 and a half years now, and to a certain extent, I can see my development as a person through my poetry. You can imagine the type of poetry a teenager who didn’t accept the idea of a God would write. It was very jarring to go back and read, now that I am holding where I am. [medium pause] The subjects of my poetry were so profoundly empty – it was the level of ???? and ????. [small pause] The things I was aspiring to, the things I was chasing after, were so empty, [small pause] and it left me feeling so full of emptiness. I can tell you that a person like that, ???? ???? ???? – that’s not called living. [small pause] That was my mitzrayim. [larger pause] There was a time when I was still trying to find who I was and where I fit in, and during that time I took a long break from poetry, because whenever I sat down to write, all that would come out were tones of confusion of how I felt and who I thought of myself as, and the stark clash of who I had made myself into and who I now wanted to become. My identity was really changing.
•	I still today have a certain aspect of ???? ???? in me, to be different than everyone else like Avraham avinu was – who was called an ???? because he went against the grain – because I had to totally separate myself from my old chevra, but I wasn’t yet ready for the new chevra because it was too much of a jump for me.
•	How can you thank Hashem? With your life. Lihavdil eleph… a gang leader who saved a person’s life
   o	That is the pshat in the ramvhal about zerizus
•	Rabbi Reingold’s schmooze: thank you Hashem for the opportunity to remember how bad it was and how good it is now. Such a beautiful thought it brought tears to my eyes!
