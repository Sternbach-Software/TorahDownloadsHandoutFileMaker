<p>Rav Belsky was one of the greatest Torah minds of his generation, a preeminent posek and rosh yeshiva whose guidance was sought by tens of thousands of Jews across the globe. His genius was unparalleled and his breadth of knowledge unsurpassed in his time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born on August 22, 1938, Rav Belsky was a son of Rabbi Berel and Chana Tzirel Belsky. His maternal grandfather was the legendary Torah pioneer, Rav Binyomin Wilhelm zt&rdquo;l, founder of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. Rav Belsky learned at and received semichah from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in 1962, and from Rav Moshe Feinstein zt&rdquo;l in 1965.

<p>Rabbi Yaakov Bender was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn to a family that has been steeped in Torah learning and education for generations. His father, Rabbi David Bender, was the principal of the Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in Brooklyn, and was deeply involved in the rescue of European Jewry during WWII. His mother, a devoted student of the legendary Sara Schenirer, founder of the Bais Yaakov movement in Cracow, Poland, arrived on these shores on the last boat out of Poland before the War. Here, she continued her teacher&#39;s work and helped found the Bais Yaakov movement in America, a pioneering effort to educate girls from very observant families. As a young child, exposed to both his parents&#39; activities in combining Jewish education with acts of great kindness, Yaakov Bender dreamed that he would someday be able to follow in his parents&#39; footsteps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While still in high school, Yaakov Bender became the branch leader of the Pirchei Youth Movement of Agudath Israel of America. A graduate of Mirrer Yeshiva Central Institute, he received his rabbinical ordination there in 1971. After his marriage in 1972 to Ms. Bryna Diskind, also an educator, and the daughter of educators, he continued his post-graduate studies at the Mirrer Yeshiva. In 1973, Rabbi Bender founded the Flatbush branch of the Hatzalah Volunteer Ambulance Squad. He served on the Central Board of Hatzalah for 20 years. In 1978 he moved to Far Rockaway to take his first formal teaching position at Yeshiva Darchei Torah. He also founded a Hatzalah branch there as well. Six months later, he was chosen to lead the school as its principal. Under his leadership, the yeshiva has grown from a small school with a student body of 140 students to a widely known and respected Torah institute of more than 800 students.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Bender feels that his greatest accomplishment in education is his founding of the Rabenstein Special Education Center at the Yeshiva. More than 100 special education and multihandicapped students from all over the country are served by what is considered to be one of the best special education centers in the United States.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most difficult aspect of his work is to juggle the needs of the gifted and academically superior students, who make up a large part of the school, with those of the special children. He is succeeding. Although separate classes may be necessary to accommodate different levels of academic work, inclusion within a school enriches every child. Rabbi Bender reaches out to every student to bring out the most in each and every child. Each child, in turn, learns the value of every individual. (bio from covenantfn.org)<\/p>

His father adopted his father-in-law's surname, Elyashiv, in order to gain a certificate to enter the country at the advice of the famed Chofetz Chaim of Rodin, Poland.<br \/><br \/>Although Rav Elyashiv never attended a formal yeshiva framework, he was recognized as a genius in Talmud study at a young age. He was appointed as a Rabbinic Court Judge (dayan) to the High Court of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel by Israel&rsquo;s Chief Rabbi at the time, Rav Yitzchak Herzog &ndash; who exempted him from the rabbinical examinations due to his high level of scholarship. He resigned from this position in 1972 and for the next 40 years of his life, held no official positions.

On one occasion, members of his household noticed that he had been standing during his learning and asked why he did not sit down. He answered that since he was tired, he feared that he may drowse while learning. If he stood, he would be sure not to doze off. Rav Elyashiv used to receive visitors from around the globe on a daily basis in addition to leading rabbis and politicians of Israel, answering their complex halachic inquiries. Despite his advanced age and illness, he continued responding to questions from rabbis around the world with total lucidity until the very end. Even when he was sick in hospital, he continued to rise at 2:00 a.m. for his regular studies.<br \/><br \/>(Bio excerpt from aish.com)<\/p>

Rabbi Ahron Garfinkel , from Monsey, N.Y., has taught Gemara with  fundamental  Lomdus to older Talmidim for the past forty  years. He developed  a style of teaching explained in a kuntress he published entitled, \u201cV\u2019Harev Na\u201d A GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING AND ENJOYING GEMARA B\u2019 IYUN. The goal in his Shiurim is CLARITY - to first see and understand clearly the difficulties in the Sugya that warrant the need for Lomdus. Only then comes the step of selecting the main Reshonim and Achronim who focus on those difficulties and reveal layers of Torah Lomdus which illuminate the Sugya .  Each talmid can then continue on his own to go as deeply as his desire and potential will take him. Recently Rabbi Garfinkel  moved to Lakewood and started MECHON TORAS CHESED, a project dedicated to  enhancing the appreciation  and geshmak of learning  Gemara with Lomdus, by  distributing  Kuntreissim and Mp3 CDs of past  Shiurim.

<p>Harav Mordechai Gifter zt'l was born in 1915, in Portsmouth, Virginia. He was raised in Baltimore, Maryland where his father Reb Yisroel owned a grocery. He attended the Baltimore City Public Schools and received his religious education in after-school programs. As a young man Rav Gifter studied in the Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University in New York, New York, under the tutelage of Rabbi Moshe Aaron Poleyeff and Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. His uncle, Dr. Samuel Saar, was the Dean of the Seminary. In 1932 at Saar's advice, Gifter traveled to Lithuania to study in the Telshe Yeshiva. Rav Gifter was immediately accepted for admission and placed in advanced classes. He developed a strong bond with Rabbi Zalman Bloch, the Dean of Students at the yeshiva. He eventually became engaged to Bloch's daughter. In 1937, prior to his wedding, Rav Gifter returned home to the United States to visit his parents in Baltimore. He planned on returning to Lithuania for his wedding and to resume his studies. When it became obvious that he would be unable to return due to the political climate of the late 1930s, he arranged for his bride's family to join him in the United States. Only his bride came; the family chose not to abandon their community in its time of greatest need. The Gifters married in Baltimore, with Mrs. Gifter's family still in war-torn Lithuania. Shortly thereafter, Rav Gifter was appointed to the pulpit of the Nusach Ari Synagogue in northwest Baltimore. He soon became well known as an invigorating speaker and refined orator. His lectures and addresses became popular throughout the Baltimore area, and his national reputation began to grow as well. In addition to his rabbinic position Rav Gifter was appointed an adjunct lecturer at the expanding Ner Israel Rabbinical College headed by Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman. He was the first native Baltimorean to lead a congregation in the city.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1941 Rabbi moved to Waterbury, Connecticut and assumed a rabbinic pulpit in that community. In 1944 Rabbi Gifter was called to moved to Cleveland, Ohio to join the faculty of his alma mater, the newly re-established Rabbinical College of Telshe, which was moved from Telshe, Lithuania to Cleveland. The original school and Telshe community were almost completely destroyed by the Nazis and Lithuanian militia. In 1964 he was appointed assistant Dean to Rabbi Boruch Sorotzkin.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1977, Rabbi Gifter brought 20 students from Cleveland to Eretz Yisroel and opened a branch of the college in the town of Kiryat Ye'arim (Telz-Stone) near Jerusalem, leaving Rabbi Sorotzkin in charge of the Cleveland campus. In addition to teaching his students, Rabbi Gifter delivered a shiur (Torah lecture) on the Minchas Chinuch on Fridays in Jerusalem, attracting many Torah scholars. Notes from that shiur were eventually compiled in a sefer called Pitei Mincha. When Rabbi Sorotzkin died in 1979, Rabbi Gifter was sent back to the United States to lead the Cleveland campus and the Israeli branch closed. Rabbi Gifter never recovered from the tremendous loss that he felt for his first love, Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel), and did not return to his on-campus residence, but moved into small quarters in the students' dormitory to accentuate his feeling of being in \"golus\" (exile). For many years he led the presidium and leadership council (Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah) of Agudath Israel of America. He was one of the electrifying speakers in the Jewish world. Rabbi Gifter maintained a relationship with his first faculty position at Ner Israel Rabbinical College, returning to Baltimore annually to visit his daughter and son-in-law and friends.

<p>Harav Aaron Kotler zt'l came to the United States from Lithuania, where he founded Beis Medrash Govoha in Lakewood New Jersey. Rav Kotler was born in &#346;vis&#322;a&#269;, Russian Empire (now Belarus) in 1891. He was orphaned at the age of 10 and adopted by his uncle, Rabbi Yitzchak Pinnes, a Dayan in Minsk. He studied in the Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania under the \"Alter (elder) of Slabodka\", Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, and Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein. After learning there, he joined his father-in-law, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, to run the yeshiva of Slutsk. After World War I, the yeshivah moved from Slutsk to Kletsk in Belarusia. With the outbreak of World War II, Rav Kotler and the yeshivah relocated to Vilna, then the major refuge of most yeshivoth from the occupied areas. He was later brought to America in 1941 by the Vaad Hatzalah rescue organization and guided it during the Holocaust. In 1943, Rav Kotler founded Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, with 15 students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived in America, he was told that he is wasting his time trying to rebuild what was destroyed in Europe because Jewish students of college age were interested only in earning a degree that will enable them to make money and have no interest in learning and mastering the ability to understand the Talmud just for its own sake. Rabbi Kotler responded that he will \"plant\" Torah in America and declared this to be his life's mission. Through his yeshiva he rebuilt Torah throughout America. He would send the best of his senior students to open other yeshivahs throughout North America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of Rav Kotler's petera in 1962, the yeshiva had grown to 250 students.He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Shneur Kotler, as rosh yeshiva. As of 2011, Beis Medrash Govoha is run by his grandson, Rabbi Malkiel Kotler, and three of his grandsons-in-law, Rabbis Yerucham Olshin, Yisroel Neuman, and Dovid Schustal. By 2007 the yeshiva had grown into the largest institution of its kind in America with 5,000 talmidim, while the surrounding Lakewood community supports a network of 50 other yeshivas and over 100 synagogues for an Orthodox population estimated at 40,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRav Kotler also helped establish Chinuch Atzmai, the independent religious school system in Israel and was the chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel. He chaired the Rabbinical administration board of Torah Umesorah and was on the presidium of the Agudas HaRabbonim of the U.S. and Canada.<\/p>

<p>Rabbi Yosef Tendler zt\u201dl, longtime menahel of Yeshiva Ner Yisroel High School in Baltimore<\/p><p>Rav Tendler was a son of Rav Isaac Tendler, a talmid of Radin in Europe. When he came to America, Rav Isaac learned at Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchok Elchonon on the Lower East Side near the Tendler home and eventually took the position as rov of the Kaminetzer Shul.<\/p><p>As a child and teen, Rav Yosef was a student at Rabbi Jacob Joseph School in New York from first through 12th grades. After high school, Rav Tendler attended Yeshiva University in Washington Heights. He was placed in a level where one could aspire to enter the shiur of Rav Yoshe Ber Soloveitchik the following year. In order to prepare himself, Rav Tendler decided to do some \u201cenrichment\u201d during the summer. With two friends from YU, he went to learn at Bais Medrash Govoah in Lakewood. He had no intention of staying and, in fact, had re-registered for the next term at YU.<\/p><p>When he came to take leave of the rosh yeshiva, Rav Aharon Kotler, at the end of the summer of 1950, Rav Aharon asked him to come back to Lakewood for Simchas Torah, to which he agreed.  He was so uplifted by the ruach of that Simchas Torah that he decided to stay for one year. During the Hakafos, Rav Elya Svei took Rav Tendler to Rav Aharon and asked the rosh yeshiva to tell him to remain in Lakewood.<\/p><p>In 1950, when Rav Tendler was in Lakewood, the yeshiva had approximately 40 bochurim and 20 yungeleit. When Rav Tendler left Lakewood eleven years later, there were approximately 60 bochurim and 40 yungeleit.<\/p><p>Some of the other Lakewood talmidim in Rav Tendler\u2019s time included Rav Meir Hershkowitz, rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Bais Binyomin of Stamford; Rav Chaim Epstein, rosh yeshiva of  Yeshiva Zichron Meilech; Rav Yankel Schiff, son-in-law of the Brisker Rav; Rav Yisroel Meir Kagan and Rav Yitzchok Wasserman, roshei yeshiva of Yeshiva Toras Chaim of Denver; Rav Yaakov Schnaidman and Rav Chaim Bressler, roshei yeshiva of Yeshiva Bais Moshe Scranton; Rav Yechiel Perr, rosh yeshiva of  Yeshiva Derech Ayson of Far Rockaway; Rav Meir Stern, rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Gedolah of Passaic; Rav Moshe Hillel Hirsch, rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Slabodka in Bnei Brak; and Rav Yitzchok Feigelstock, rosh yeshiva of  Mesivta of Long Beach.<\/p><p>After his second year in Lakewood, Rav Tendler went to Rav Aharon to discuss leaving the yeshiva, as he wanted to return to Yeshiva University to get a degree. It was almost unheard of in those days not to get a college degree for reasons of parnassah. Rav Aharon said to Rav Tendler, \u201cHow can you rely on the seichel of a teenager to decide your future? I am older and have more experience in life. Rely on me.\u201d And Rav Tendler stayed on.<\/p><p>Rav Aharon was Rav Tendler\u2019s shadchan. One day, Rav Tendler was sitting and learning in the bais medrash and he noticed a gentleman looking at him. This guest was walking around, but Rav Tendler sensed that he was observing him. That turned out to be Rav Tendler\u2019s future father-in-law, Rav Menachem Perr, who was friendly with Rav Aharon and Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky from their days in Slabodka. When he came to America, he learned at Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchok Elchonon on the Lower East Side under the Maiseter Illuy, and he later served as rov in South Ozone Park, near Kennedy Airport.<\/p><p>Rav Tendler learned in kollel for more than three years and then left because he ran out of money. He went to Rav Aharon, who told Rav Tendler that he should apply to teach the 5th grade at Bezalel Hebrew Day School in Lakewood and that, if he was hired, he should still come learn in the yeshiva in the afternoon and receive the $40 kollel check. Rav Tendler applied but someone else was hired.<\/p><p>In 1961, Rav Aharon sent Rav Tendler to apply for a 6th grade position in Asbury Park with the same stipulation that he could continue in kollel while teaching in the morning. That also didn\u2019t work out.  A couple of days later, Rav Dov Schwartzman, Rav Aharon\u2019s son-in-law, went to Rav Tendler and said that he had gotten a call from Rav Yaakov Weinberg that Yeshiva Ner Yisroel was seeking in a rebbi to teach 12th grade.  The mechinah had been founded in 1957 and there had been a turnover of menahelim every year. After teaching 12th grade for one year, Rav Tendler was asked to teach the first shiur in the yeshiva. At that time, Rav Weinberg asked Rav Tendler to suggest someone to teach his 12th grade shiur. Rav Tendler called one of his chavrusos in Lakewood, Rav Moshe Heinemann. He told Rav Tendler that he had enough money to last one more year in kollel and felt that he had no right to leave Lakewood, where he was gaining so much. Consequently, Rav Tendler called another of his chaveirim in Lakewood, Rav Nosson Nussbaum, and proposed that he come to teach the 12th grade in the Ner Yisroel mechinah. He went for a \u201cprobeh\u201d and was given the position.<\/p><p>In 1964, having gone through seven menahelim from 1957 to 1964, Rav Weinberg, with the haskamah of the rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Ner Yisroel, Rav Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman zt\u201dl, asked Rav Tendler to become the menahel of the mechinah and also to teach one of the 12th grade shiurim .<\/p><p>Rav Tendler spent the ensuing decades \u2013 over 45 years \u2013 wholly devoted to the yeshiva, inspiring generations of talmidim and imparting the lessons learned from his rabbeim.<\/p><p>Among his many achievements was founding Pride of the Farm when he identified a need for cholov Yisroel products. He took great pride in it and offered his guidance and expertise for years without remuneration.<\/p>\r\n<p>Rav Tendler was a son of Rav Isaac Tendler, a talmid of Radin in Europe.

Rabbi Noah Weinberg, head of the Aish Hatorah Yeshiva and one of the trailblazers of Orthodox Jewish outreach (kiruv). Rabbi Weinberg who grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, received his Torah education at Brooklyn's Yeshivas Chaim Berlin and Baltimore's Ner Yisrael Yeshiva, which was headed by his older brother Rabbi Ya'acov Weinberg. Rabbi Weinberg, arrived in Israel about four decades ago and studied at the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem and at Yeshivat Hanegev in Netivot. In the 1960s, Rabbi Weinberg established yeshivos and educational programs aimed at young Jewish men with secular backgrounds who were interested in embracing traditional Judaism. He was co-founder of the capital's Ohr Somayach and Aish Hatorah. \r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, he left Ohr Somayach due to his different educational philosophy. While Ohr Somayach encouraged its students to dedicate their lives to studying Torah, Rabbi Weinberg believed that after several years of study students who were the object of outreach should themselves get involved in reaching out to secular Jews, or they should find work in a secular workplace and influence fellow workers to embrace an Orthodox way of life.
